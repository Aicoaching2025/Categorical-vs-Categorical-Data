# 📊 Analyzing Associations Between Categorical Variables

## 📝 Lesson Overview
In this lesson, we used various methods to assess **whether two categorical variables are associated**. Although our examples focused on **binary variables** (only two categories per variable), the same methods can be applied to **non-binary categorical variables**.

### **Methods Used**
✅ Contingency Tables (Frequencies)  
✅ Contingency Tables (Proportions)  
✅ Marginal Proportions  
✅ Expected Contingency Tables  
✅ Chi-Square Statistic

## 📊 Visualizing Associations Between Categorical Variables
### **Example 1: Contingency Table of Frequencies**
This table summarizes the number of occurrences for each category.


### **Example 2: Contingency Table of Proportions**
This table converts the frequency table into proportions.


### **Example 3: Chi-Square Test Results**
The **Chi-Square test** determines if the observed distribution is **significantly different from the expected distribution**.

**Chi-Square Statistic:**
